# Webpack federated modules test
An example repo of how we might use webpack federated modules.

### To Test:
Run `yarn install && yarn workspaces run build && npx serve` from the project root and navigate to the local server in your browser.

Tested using node v14. Previous versions might not work. I use [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to manage my node versions.
